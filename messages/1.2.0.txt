SmartVHDL 1.2.0 Changelog:

## Enhancement ##
  - Indexation:
    * instance name are now part of project-wide symbol list
    * instance type are now in the reference list (new feature in ST3 3148)
  - Hierarchy:
    * Add option to open the hierarchy in a new window (vhdl.hierarchy_new_window)
    * Add function to navigate from the hierarchy to the instance or module name properly.
    * Add marker [U] for unresolved reference, and [C] for component only


## Fix ##
  - Settings:
  	* Fix incorrect path to the settings file
  	* use core function to open default and user file side by side
  - Highlight:
    * Fix incorrect highlight of component inside package
  - Parsing:
    * now support old-style end for architecture where neither architecture nor name are provided


## Keybind Update ##
To use the new function to navigate in the hierarchy add the following keybind:

```
  {
    "keys": ["f12"], "command": "vhdl_hierarchy_goto_definition",
    "context":
    [
      { "key": "selector", "operator": "equal", "operand": "text.result-vhdl"}
    ]
  }
```

It is also possible to bind some mouse click, but be aware that sublime does not support
context sensitive binding, meaning that you will override whatever was bind to the mouse click !
Here is an example to bind 'ctrl+right click' to the command:

```
  {
        "button": "button2", "modifiers": ["ctrl"],
        "command": "vhdl_hierarchy_goto_definition",
        "press_command": "drag_select",
    }
```
